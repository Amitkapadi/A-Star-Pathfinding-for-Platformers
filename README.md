###Tuts+ Tutorial: How to Adapt A* Pathfinding to a 2D Grid-Based Platformer
####Instructor: Daniel Branicki

In this tutorial series, I'll explain how to modify a standard A* pathfinding algorithm to work for platformers by taking into account the way gravity restricts of vertical movement. The new algorithm could be used to create an AI character that follows the player, or to show the player a route to their goal, for example.
